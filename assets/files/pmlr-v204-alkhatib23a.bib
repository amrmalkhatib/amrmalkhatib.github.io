  abstract = 	 {Score-based explainable machine-learning techniques
 are often used to understand the logic behind
 black-box models. However, such explanation
 techniques are often computationally expensive,
 which limits their application in time-critical
 contexts. Therefore, we propose and investigate the
 use of computationally less costly regression models
 for approximating the output of score-based
 explanation techniques, such as SHAP. Moreover,
 validity guarantees for the approximated values are
 provided by the employed inductive conformal
 prediction framework. We propose several
 non-conformity measures designed to take the
 difficulty of approximating the explanations into
 account while keeping the computational cost low. We
 present results from a large-scale empirical
 investigation, in which the approximate explanations
 generated by our proposed models are evaluated with
 respect to efficiency (interval size). The results
 indicate that the proposed method can significantly
 improve execution time compared to the fast version
 of SHAP, TreeSHAP. The results also suggest that the
 proposed method can produce tight intervals, while
 providing validity guarantees. Moreover, the
 proposed approach allows for comparing explanations
 of different approximation methods and selecting a
 method based on how informative (tight) are the
 predicted intervals.}
